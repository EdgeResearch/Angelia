This University work consists of an in-depth study and a fully working *privacy-oriented*, *open-source*, *lightweight* browser extension that allows to **verify** *Fake news' titles* and *AI synthetic images*. 

It is inspired by the earlier paper [ConvNet frameworks for multi-modal fake news detection](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10489-021-02345-y), which uses trusted sources and polarity analysis for fake news detection.
